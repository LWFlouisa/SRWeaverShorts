A young Japanese woman with a hand gun, slowly opens a door into an apartment. Gun drawn, she uses a tool to check the innards of its walls: “So far, no bombs in the walls. Only cockroaches, which everyone has”. She wears a pair of skin tight blue jeans, and man’s long sleeve pink button up. She finds instead of it being a studio, there is a long hallway that goes to another section of the studio. She takes her camera to study around the wall and into the next studio, by controlling a drone that studies the current threat while presenting itself as a something no larger than a fly.

The further it flew, the darker the studio got, until eventually the network went into a different floor and wall installment, where it had different server installations. The it stopped at a U crossing, where at the end of it was a staircase downward. Seeing as there were luckily people with guns with invisible shielding, she slowly walk into the studio clinging onto the wall. Once she reached the studio clinging to the outside wall, she activated her invisible shield.

Here she walked slowly, because the floor was metal out of metal framing, unless the rest of the studio network. There was a British guy that walked around with his gun drawn. There was someone else, a fat woman who had shoulder length hair, accompanying his presence.

The investigator in invisible shielding blew up her camera drone in the downstairs that direct their attention. Once the British guy left into the downstairs hallway, she activated another camera drone as a replacement. After funding out the real facility in which the two worked, she found this was part of a larger encampment of people of their ilk, that kept a stockpile of supplies. She blew up her second camera drone in the second hallway. The British guy walked up the stairs to tell her he has found a camera drone, but instead thinking it was someone else, she put a bullet in the head of the British room mate. Figuring out what she did, she put a bullet in her mouth.

– That takes care of the guard problem, said the agent. She deactivated her invisible shield, took out a third and final camera drone. Then clung to the wall. Her drone was installed with its own micro-weaponry, a special air toxin that puts you to sleep in thirty seconds after breathing it in.

One of the other fellow catacomb campers walked outside the hallway to see what the noise was up stairs. The agent used the camera drone as a lure to misdirect this person, then activated the poisonous gas.

Quickly the agent goes through the downstairs walkway, careful to cling to the walls. She found that this was a much larger hallway connecting a network of abandoned office buildings; similarly to old medieval communes, they posted their agreement upon the entrance.

With her shield still activated, she made a report: most of the guards are dead, but there was one still alive the police can take in for questioning. Carefully, she exited the back exit, so as to avoid disturbing the other residence, who were asleep at this hour. Then deactivated her invisible shield.

– Dodged a bullet there.</p>

The police activated the invisible shielding, then apprehended the live suspect. They carefully made sure not to wake up the other residence, who will simply wake up to find the suspect has vanished.

– We got a live one. Group running an illegal server farm.

Later, on a plea bargain, the woman met the agent, who offered her her life in exchange for information about the rest of the server operators. – We can even make you an agent.
